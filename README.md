# Welcome ! ðŸ‘‹

#### About me :

I'm Solenn, I'm 23 and I'm living in Marseille.
Since September 2019, I'm studying web development. I never wrote a line of code before that, and now I can work with HTML/CSS, PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript. I'm currently learning Symfony, which I like a lot, for a professional project. 
I'm looking for a work-study for September 2020.
I'm curious and I have a strong team spirit, I love to learn new things each day :smiley:

In my free time, I like to play video games (Biding of Isaac, Skyrim, The Witcher..) and draw doodles. I also enjoy baking cookies and feed my workmates with it.
I read a lot: comic book, sci-fi, fantasy, I'm a huge fan of Terry Pratchett :purple_heart:
